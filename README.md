# Problem Statement
Our client is an Insurance company that has provided Health Insurance to its customers. Now they need the help in building a model to predict whether the policyholders (customers) from the past year will also be interested in Vehicle Insurance provided by the company.

An insurance policy is an arrangement by which a company undertakes to provide a guarantee of compensation for specified loss, damage, illness, or death in return for the payment of a specified premium. A premium is a sum of money that the customer needs to pay regularly to an insurance company for this guarantee.
